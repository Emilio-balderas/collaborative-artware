# Collaborative Artware

In this course we'll be working together as an open source arts collective. We'll produce an online app which explores the expressive space between software as a tool and software as art. We'll learn the processes and tools that professional creative technologists use when working together to produce "software art" projects. This is an intermediate level coding course with work being predominantly written in JavaScript (server side and client side). While proficiency in JavaScript is not required, it's recommended that students have a background in basic programming concepts (data types, variables, functions, conditions, loops, etc) as this course will build on those to introduce more intermediate level concepts and programming paradigms.

This is the main code repository for our collaborative project. See to the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/net-art-uchicago/collaborative-artware/wiki) for the class Syllabus and other notes.
